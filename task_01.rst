Why I Love Python
#################

Why I love **Python**, a language worth knowing.

**********
Running It
**********

Python syntax is really quite simple to execute. Anyone can do it just by executing the ``python`` command on the command line and invoking the interpreter.

You can also execute python programs by calling the program filename such as:

.. code:: console
 
    me@mymachine $ python my_file_name.py

**********
The Syntax
**********
Python syntax is very easy to write. Take a look at this simple statement:

.. code:: python

    >>> print 'Hello!'

**********
The People
**********

It's amazing how nice people are in the Python development world. Just as with any community, however, it's important to follow certain rules of decorum.

- Be courteous to others

- Always read the manual before asking questions

- Be succinct in your questions

    * Don't give unnecessary details if they aren't needed
    
    
    * Don't start a question with an apology or an announcement that you're going to ask the question.


    *Just ask the question!*   

*********
The Tools
*********

Python has a ton of excellent tools available for use.


Docutils
========

A fantastic documentation generator that interprets reStructuredText and turns it into rich documents.


Web Frameworks
==============

Python has many great web frameworks, only a few of which will be listed here.

Django
------

One of the world's leading content management systems for the web. To learn more about Django, visit:

A relative newcomer to the web framework work. Pyramid began as part of the pylons project and has an interesting (although challenging) templating language.
